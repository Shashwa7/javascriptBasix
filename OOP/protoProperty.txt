what '__proto_' property actually is ?
 
 > Every object in JS has a prototype including user define objects.
 > Prototypes contains all the methods for that object type.


eg: 
> Array obj prototype(__proto__): sort(), filter() etc.
> Date obj prototype(__proto__): getDay(), getMonth() etc. 

inorder to look for menthods that paraticular object has access to we can use '.prototype' keyword;

eg: Array.prototype; > will show all methods that an array obj can access, like filter(), map(), slice()

> why we want to add functions/methods in the object's '__proto__' ?

> 2 benifits:
1> efficient fetch; as all methods are stored in the single place. Not in many different locations as we create new obj instance using the constructor.

2> It will help in prototyple inheritance.
